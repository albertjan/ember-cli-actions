# Ember-cli-actions

Tired of embedding all actions in your `route.js` file? Ember-cli-actions is an
ember addon that allows you to write your actions in an `actions.js` file.

The provided `ActionMixin` then automatically imports all actions in your `action.js` file
binds them to the route, and passes them down to the model to be used.
